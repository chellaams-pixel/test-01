# Rust Automation Orchestrator - System Summary

## üéØ Project Overview

The Rust Automation Orchestrator is a comprehensive automation system built in Rust that provides:

- **System Flow Management**: Orchestrates complex automation tasks with dependency management
- **Upload SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)**: Standardized file upload processing with validation, backup, compression, and metadata extraction
- **Workflow Engine**: Executes multi-step workflows with retry logic, timeouts, and conditional execution
- **Task Management**: Tracks and manages automation tasks with unique IDs and status monitoring

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AutomationOrchestrator** (`src/orchestrator/mod.rs`)
   - Main orchestrator that manages all automation tasks
   - Provides task tracking, status monitoring, and cleanup
   - Controls concurrent execution with semaphores

2. **UploadManager** (`src/upload/mod.rs`)
   - Handles file uploads with SOP compliance
   - Implements 5-step upload process: Validate ‚Üí Backup ‚Üí Copy ‚Üí Compress ‚Üí Metadata
   - Provides automatic archiving and record management

3. **WorkflowEngine** (`src/workflow/mod.rs`)
   - Executes workflow definitions in JSON format
   - Supports step dependencies, conditional execution, and retry logic
   - Provides timeout control and variable substitution

4. **Configuration System** (`src/config/mod.rs`)
   - YAML-based configuration with environment variable support
   - Configurable upload limits, workflow settings, and system parameters

5. **Utility Modules** (`src/utils/`)
   - File operations, validation, and compression utilities
   - Reusable components for common automation tasks

## üìÅ Upload SOP Process

The upload process follows a standardized 5-step procedure:

1. **Validation**: Check file size, extension, and integrity
2. **Backup**: Create backup copy if enabled
3. **Copy**: Copy file to upload directory
4. **Compression**: Compress file if enabled (with ratio tracking)
5. **Metadata**: Generate automatic tags and metadata

### Example Upload Flow:
```
test_file.txt (65 bytes)
    ‚Üì Validation ‚úì
    ‚Üì Backup: ./backups/[id]_[timestamp].bak
    ‚Üì Copy: ./uploads/test_file.txt
    ‚Üì Compression: ./uploads/test_file.gz (ratio: 0.74)
    ‚Üì Metadata: tags=["ext:gz", "uploaded:2025-09-02"]
    ‚Üì Record: ./uploads/records/[id].json
```

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Workflow Engine

### Features:
- **Dependency Management**: Steps can depend on other steps
- **Conditional Execution**: Steps can be skipped based on conditions
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Timeout Control**: Configurable timeouts per step
- **Variable Substitution**: Dynamic variable replacement in commands

### Example Workflow:
```json
{
  "id": "workflow-id",
  "name": "Simple Test Workflow",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "step1",
      "name": "Echo Hello",
      "command": "echo",
      "args": ["Hello from workflow!"],
      "depends_on": []
    },
    {
      "id": "step2", 
      "name": "List Files",
      "command": "ls",
      "args": ["-la"],
      "depends_on": ["step1"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Upload Processing:
```bash
# Process a file upload
cargo run -- --upload test_file.txt --verbose

# Output:
# - File validated and backed up
# - Compressed with 0.74 ratio
# - Metadata generated with tags
# - Record saved for tracking
```

### Workflow Execution:
```bash
# Execute a workflow
cargo run -- --workflow workflows/simple_workflow.json --verbose

# Output:
# - Steps executed in dependency order
# - Each step output captured
# - Execution record saved
```

### Configuration:
```yaml
upload:
  upload_dir: "./uploads"
  max_file_size: 104857600  # 100MB
  allowed_extensions: ["txt", "pdf", "doc", "zip"]
  compression_enabled: true
  backup_enabled: true

workflow:
  workflow_dir: "./workflows"
  max_concurrent_workflows: 4
  timeout_seconds: 3600
  retry_attempts: 3
```

## üìä System Flow

### Task Lifecycle:
1. **Task Creation**: Unique ID assigned, status set to Pending
2. **Execution**: Semaphore acquired, status set to Running
3. **Completion**: Status set to Completed/Failed, record saved
4. **Cleanup**: Old tasks removed after 24 hours

### Upload Flow:
1. **Validation**: File size, extension, readability checks
2. **SOP Execution**: 5-step standardized process
3. **Record Creation**: JSON record with metadata
4. **Archive**: Automatic archiving of old files

### Workflow Flow:
1. **Loading**: Parse JSON workflow definition
2. **Dependency Resolution**: Topological sort of steps
3. **Execution**: Execute steps with retry/timeout logic
4. **Recording**: Save execution record with outputs
